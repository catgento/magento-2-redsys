# Redsys PSP Module for Magento 2

This is a Magento that integrates Redsys PSP with Magento 2. It takes its base from https://github.com/MagestioEcommerce/redsys-tpv, but changes have been done to integrate it with packagist so that the module can be installed via Composer.

This might be a 'temporary' repository until the people from Magestio do the corresponding changes to their module to make it installable from Composer.

```
    composer require catgento/magento-2-redsys
```
